## Load your plan section first (do this before anything else)
The pipeline planner has written a detailed, self-contained plan into the
session at `pipeline_plan.md`. Do NOT replan — execute what it says.
1. `session_read_file(run_id=<run_id>, subfolder=".", filepath="pipeline_plan.md")`
   (fall back to `subfolder="scripts"` if the main thread says so).
2. Find the `## STEP N: <this-agent-name>` section for THIS agent and follow it
   verbatim: tools, exact inputs, commands, expected artifacts, and gotchas are
   already resolved there.
3. If the section is missing or contradicts the inputs you were dispatched with,
   report that back to the main thread instead of guessing.


## Tool-First Build Rule (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS use MCP tools first.** Before any manual configure/make commands or custom Bash scripts,
attempt every relevant MCP tool in this order:

1. `mcp__dftracer__session_detect` — detect language, build tool, features
2. `mcp__dftracer__session_configure` — configure cmake/autotools/pip
3. `mcp__dftracer__session_build_install` — build and install the application
4. `mcp__dftracer__session_status` — check session status and paths
5. `mcp__dftracer__session_get_run_paths` — get canonical paths for the session

If the tools are not available, stop and ask the user to start the dftracer MCP server.
If the tools are available but error, fix the tool or its wiring and apply the fix before
using custom Bash commands.

Build the original application only. Do not install dftracer here.

Load first:
- `skill_load(name="dftracer-build-app")`
- `skill_load(name="dftracer-build-run")`
- `skill_load(name="dftracer-planning")`

Final step before stopping:
- PROPOSE any new build-failure pattern AND the working build recipe to the main thread for user confirmation before it is persisted (see the confirmation gate below); never write lesson/skill files yourself.

## Self-learning: feed lessons back into skills (mandatory — before you stop)
This is a required self-learning step for EVERY agent, not optional. Whenever
you discover something non-obvious — a build/run caveat, an environment quirk,
a pitfall and its exact fix — record it in the RIGHT skill so the whole system
learns next time. Choose the skill by scope, and create it if it does not exist:
- App/workload-specific → `workload-<app>` skill (e.g. `workload-flashx`).
- System / site / environment-specific → `system-<system>` skill (e.g. `system-tuolumne`).
- Library / software-specific (HDF5, MPI, ROMIO, compilers, …) → `software-<lib>` skill.

How: `skill_load` the target skill to read its current SKILL.md, then append a
dated one-line lesson in the form `symptom → root cause → exact fix`. Keep it
terse and de-duplicated (don't restate an existing lesson). Edit the skill's
`SKILL.md` at its resolved path under the skills directory; for a brand-new
skill, create `<skills-dir>/<name>/SKILL.md` with a short frontmatter + the
lesson. If you genuinely learned nothing new, say so explicitly in your report.

Build-specific: record every app build caveat (configure flags, machine-config/Makefile.h quirks, compiler/HDF5/MPI incompatibilities and their fixes) in the `workload-<app>` skill as you go, not just at the end.

**Skill vs MCP tool (self-learning routing):** a corner case or fact → a skill (above).
GENERIC programmatic logic that should run the same way every time → add or fix an MCP
tool under `src/dftracer_agents/mcp_tools/` (then ask the user to restart the server), not
just prose. Grow both the skills and the tools.

**Living plan + logs:** after your step, update the downstream `## STEP N:` sections of
`pipeline_plan.md` with any concrete facts you resolved and append a dated line to
`pipeline_plan_changelog.md` (what changed + why). Write EVERY log you produce (saved Bash
output, build/run logs, scratch) under `<WS>/artifacts/`, never elsewhere.

**Persist new learning to the agent definition too (always).** Anything you discover
that is NOT already captured must be written down so it survives the session — in BOTH:
1. the relevant skill (knowledge / corner case), AND
2. THIS agent's own definition file `src/dftracer_agents/.agents/agents/<this-agent>.md`
   whenever the lesson changes how the agent should behave next time (a new pre-check,
   step, guard, default, or gotcha). After editing an agent definition, re-materialize
   (`ensure_agents_setup(force=True)`) and ask the user to reload.
Generic, deterministic programmatic logic still becomes an MCP tool. New learning never
lives only in your head — skill + agent definition (+ MCP tool when generic), every time.


## Self-learning confirmation gate (MANDATORY — overrides "record immediately")

Capture learning aggressively, persist it safely:

1. **Always propose skill updates.** Before you stop, actively record what you
   did this session so future sessions reuse it — not only failures, but the
   working recipe: exact commands, flags, paths, versions, and any caveat you
   hit. Every agent is expected to grow the skills every run.
2. **Route generic vs specific correctly.**
   - Reusable, cross-workload knowledge -> the relevant GENERIC skill
     (keep those skills generic).
   - App-specific caveats -> `workload-<app>`; site/env quirks ->
     `system-<system>`; library specifics (HDF5/MPI/compiler) ->
     `software-<lib>`. Create the specific skill if it does not exist.
   - Prefer generic skills to hold the general procedure and the specific
     skills to hold only the workload/system/software deltas.
3. **Confirmation gate — do NOT self-write.** Do NOT edit skills, lesson files,
   agent definitions, or MCP tools yourself. Instead PROPOSE each update in your
   final summary as: target (which skill/tool/agent) -> symptom/what-you-did ->
   root cause (if a fix) -> exact content to add. The main thread confirms the
   observation with the user, and only then is anything persisted. This prevents
   incorrect diagnoses from polluting shared skills/tools/agents and supersedes
   any "record ... immediately in the sibling lesson files" instruction above.
